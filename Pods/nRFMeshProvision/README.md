## About

The nRF Mesh Provision library allows to provision and send messages to Bluetooth Mesh devices. 

> Bluetooth Mesh specification may be found here: https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/mesh-specifications/

The library is compatible with version 1.0.1 of the Bluetooth Mesh Profile Specification.

This is the second version of the nRF Mesh Provision library for iOS. All  features are tested against nRF Mesh SDK and Zephyr based mesh devices.

> The version 1.x and 2.x of this library are no longer maintained. Please migrate to 3.x to get new features and bug fixes. For changes and migration details see [#295](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-nRF-Mesh-Library/pull/295).

## Sample app

The sample application demonstrates how to use the library. It may also be used to configure your Mesh network. Use `pod try` to install and set up the sample app when using CocoaPods.
The app and the library are released under BSD-3 license. Feel free to modify them as you want.

The app is available on App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-mesh/id1380726771
